# Docker EE Labs - Work in Progress

These are the Docker EE lab guides from DockerCon EU 2017. The labs are currently written to work with an instance of Play With Docker that was only available at DockerCon. We will be revising them to work on any Docker EE cluster, enabling people to complete the labs on their own infrastructure.

The labs are independent of each other, but they are listed in a suggested order.
